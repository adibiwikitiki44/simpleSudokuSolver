# simpleSudokuSolver

I created a simple sudoku solver as part of creating some independent projects. This is one of the first. I have tried to keep things as neat as possible. Growing up I always loved playing Sudoku on my parents old candy phones. So figured why not code one. Even though it is not user interactive, I am working on creating another one that will be user interactive so any user can actually play it (Text-based).
